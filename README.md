# Knights-Travails
The Knights Travails project from The Odin Project

## Description
This is the Knights Travails project from The Odin project's curriculum. This script finds the shortest path, using breadth first search, from one square to another on a chess board by Knight moves. The Knight moves 2 squares in one direction and 1 square in the perpendicular direction.

## Use
* Call the pathFrom function with 2 squares.
* Squares are defined by [row, col] with [0, 0] being in the top left of the board (this is contrary to how a chess board is usually defined with row numbers and file letters).
* Example: pathFrom([0, 0], [3, 3]).
* The script will then output the number of steps and the squares in the path to the console.

## Credits
* [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) for the project description and providing the skills necessary.
* [Mary Elaine Cline on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_m27bhVQQQ) for teaching how to do breadth first search on a unweighted graph.
